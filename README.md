Newtonian Rustsody, a rust Newton's fractal generator, hoping to expand to more general fractals soon.

Usage:
| Key | Function                                     |
|-----|----------------------------------------------|
| `q` | Quit                                         |
| `g` | Generate the fractal with current view       |
| `r` | Rescale the view back to the last generation |
| `s` | Save the last generated image to file        |
